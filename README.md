# COVID-19-Organization-Engagement-Pulse-Survey

The purpose of this survey and analysis was to provide senior leadership a granular understanding of staff sentiment regarding the organization's preparation and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the lead data analyst for this project, I had to decide how we wanted to engage our staff, what variables we would consider, and finally how we presented our data. 

My methodology was as follows:

1) Engaged various departments and stakeholder groups to determine how we should survey our staff. 
    - Which questions would provide us the most meaningful feedback? 
    - How should these questions be phrased?
    - What data output should the questions produce? Should they be open-ended reponse questions? Quantitative response questions? Discrete? Continuous? 
    - What level of granuliarity should this data analysis seek to provide?
    
2) Implemented survey via Qualtrics to gather, mine, and procure data. Questions we decided on. 
    a) My Companyâ€™s leadership has a clear plan of action.
    b) During this time, My Company cares about my well-being.
    c) I feel comfortable asking my manager for a flexible work arrangement during this time.
    d) I feel well-prepared to do my job.
    e) The leader of my team keeps me informed about what is going on.
    
    * All questions were scaled from Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree (scaled 1-5)
    
3) Cleaned data in R code (attached in .rmd above) to break and partition data for analysis.

4) Analysis and final visualizations broken down by demographic, titles, and departments.
